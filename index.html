			&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<span class="email">One problem that people often overlook is inconvenience brought by physical document requests. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br> <center> <strong>We do not realize that this process involves a degree of trust from the document issuing party, the courier service, and as well as the receiving party </strong>. </center><br> We also face the risks associated with the delivery process itself such as lost, damage, or delays. Additionally, document delivery services could also cost a fortune. </span>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; 
<span class="email">It would be nice to have a system that uses cryptography to guarantee the access, privacy, and authenticity of a document as well as leverage the benefits brought by Filecoin and IPFS in ensuring the integrity and decentralization of storing a file. And this is the system we intend to build and provide.</span>
